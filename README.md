# Serial Experiments Lain Artbook Code

The first photo is from "an omnipresence in wired" released in 1999.

The second photo is from "yoshitoshi ABe lain illustrations: ab# rebuild an omnipresence in wired" (2006).

Both editions contains the code that can be converted to a file. But I don't know anyone who has already done this.

Pull requests and [discussions](https://github.com/laingame-net/lain_artbook_code/issues/1) are welcome.
